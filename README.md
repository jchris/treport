## Share test reports

There is a link in CouchDB to share test reports with the community. You can browse those test reports on the [CouchDB CouchDB](http://couchdb.couchdb.org/_utils/database.html?test_suite_reports/_design/treport/_view/test-status)

Use [CouchApp](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp) to push this code to your own CouchDB.
